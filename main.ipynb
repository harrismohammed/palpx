      "[ R2-D2 (/ˌɑːrtuːˈdiːtuː/),or Artoo-Detoo,[1] is a fictional robot character in the Star Wars franchise created by George Lucas. A small astromech droid,R2-D2 is a major character and appears in nine out of the ten Star Wars films to date. Throughout the course of the films,R2 is a friend to C-3PO,Padmé Amidala,Anakin Skywalker,Leia Organa,Luke Skywalker,and Obi-Wan Kenobi in various points in the saga. English actor Kenny Baker played R2-D2 in all three original Star Wars films,and received billing credit for the character in the prequel trilogy,where Bakers role was reduced,as R2-D2 was portrayed mainly by radio controlled props and CGI models. In the sequel trilogy,Baker was credited as consultant for The Force Awakens; however,Jimmy Vee also co-performed the character in some scenes. Vee later took over the role beginning in The Last Jedi.[2] R2-D2s sounds and vocal effects were created by Ben Burtt. R2-D2 was designed in artwork by Ralph McQuarrie,co-developed by John Stears and built by Tony Dyson. George Lucass creation of R2-D2 was influenced by Akira Kurosawas 1958 feature film The Hidden Fortress (USA release 1962),particularly Tahei and Matashichi,the two comic relief characters that serve as sidekicks to General Makabe. Lucas and artist Ralph McQuarrie also drew inspiration from the robots Huey,Dewey,and Louie from Douglas Trumbulls 1972 film Silent Running. The name derives from when Lucas was making one of his earlier films,American Graffiti. Sound editor Walter Murch states that he is responsible for the utterance which sparked the name for the droid. Murch asked for Reel 2,Dialog Track 2,in the abbreviated form \"R-2-D-2\". Lucas,who was in the room and had dozed off while working on the script for Star Wars,momentarily woke when he heard the request and,after asking for clarification,stated that it was a \"great name\" before going back to writing his script.[3][4] R2-D2 stands for Second Generation Robotic Droid Series-2,according to a Star Wars encyclopedia published after the release of the film Star Wars.[5]\n",
      "Tony Dyson,owner of the special effects studio The White Horse Toy Company,was commissioned to fabricate the design,making four units operated by remote control. Two were used by Baker,and two were stunt double models made for the scene where the droid was shot from the swamp onto the shore on Dagobah. In A New Hope,R2-D2 and C-3PO are both introduced on board the Tantive IV,along with Princess Leia of Alderaan,when they are fired upon by an Imperial Star Destroyer. Leia inserts into R2-D2 an information disc containing the plans for the Death Star battle station,and encodes a distress message on the droids holographic projector. The droids then escape in a pod that crashes on Tatooine near Obi-Wan Kenobis desert abode. R2-D2 and C-3PO are then abducted by Jawas and bought by Owen Lars,step-uncle of Luke Skywalker. While Luke cleans the sand out of R2-D2s gears,he discovers a fragment of Leias message,and removes the droids r\n"
